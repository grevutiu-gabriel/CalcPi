CalcPi
======
This simple Java program (build with Eclipse) calculate the Pi, sharing the process with threads that you can specify
when you'll run. You can specify the amount of iteractions that the program will do to calculate the Pi.

How can I run?
First you need to clone the repo and build the project. Create a .jar, then, simple run on terminal:
$java -jar CalcPi.jar --threads <NumberOfThreads> --Iterations <NumberOfIteractions>

You can use, distribute, sell or do anything with this code.

If you can make money with this application, please, share (the money) with me :P
